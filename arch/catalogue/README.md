Software catalogue
------------------
> The awesome components partners bring to KITT4SME.

Below is the software KITT4SME partners are integrating into the
platform. For each component there's a short description of what
it does, its purpose in the platform and role in the architecture
as well as why it's valuable. Please use [this template][template]
to add a new component to the list.

Also, we've started working on a [platform exploitation doc][plat-er],
but this is still early-day kind of stuff since we haven't fleshed
out key aspects like business model, strategy, etc.


### Application services

**TODO**. Group the services below by functional area according
to the KITT4SME's 3-fold value proposition—product quality, production
line reconfiguration, staff productivity.

* [AI for Quality Inspection Systems][aiqus]. AI with data augmentation
  for continuous evaluation, fine tunning and re-configuration of quality
  control. Developed by R2M.
* [Vision for Quality Excellence][viqe]. Deep learning image processing
  by Rovimatica to inspect and evaluate the quality of manufacturing
  parts.
* [Shop Floor Anomaly Detection System][anomaly]. Ginkgo's machine
  learning solution for real-time welding point anomaly detection
  and welding output Joules forecasting.
* [Milling Quality Control][roughnator]. CSIC's solution for quality
  control of micro-mechanical milling operations originally developed
  in the GAMHE 5.0 pilot line.
* [Insight Generator][ig]. Provides pivotal insights to optimise
  manufacturing systems. Insight Generator uses machine-learning
  techniques to analyse historical data and determine the most suitable
  configuration to optimise a manufacturing system depending on
  user-defined KPIs. Insight Generator has been developed by CSIC.
* [Shop Floor Reconfigurator][sfr]. AI recommender enabling in-process
  reconfiguration. It can suggest how to reconfigure shop floor machines
  in near real-time or even automatically reconfigure the machines.
  Developed by CSIC.
* [Manufacturing Process Management System][mpms]. Orchestrates humans
  and machines involved in a production line by keeping a model of the
  production process to timely assign tasks and coordinate work. Jointly
  developed by CSIC and European Dynamics.
* [Production System Profiler][ppro]. Identifies worker skills and factory
  needs at various levels—whole plant, production line, workplace. Jointly
  developed by Holonix and the Warsaw University of Technology.
* [Worker Profiler][wpro]. Service to suggest training programmes
  depending on worker's skills and aspirations as well their role
  in the company. Developed by Holonix and Gate.
* Catalogue of Qualified Training Experiences. Gate's dynamic and
  comprehensive catalogue of training experiences to be used by
  the matchmaking tool.
* [Competence Matchmaking Tool][cmt]. SUPSI's service to suggest
  personalised staff training in order to increase staff productivity
  and, consequently, production line efficiency.
* [Fatigue Monitoring System][fams]. Service for predicting the perceived fatigue exertion of workers. Developed by SUPSI.
* [SME-Oriented Platform Configurator][pc]. Developed by SUPSI.
* [Intervention Manager][im]. Service to define
intervention rules for orchestrating a production system. Developed by SUPSI.


### RAMP

* [Marketplace][ramp]. A customisation of the Robotics and Automation
  Marketplace jointly developed by European Dynamics and VTT for the
  specific needs of the KITT4SME project.
* Data sheets. Digital data sheets for module composability developed
  by VTT.
* [Adaptive Questionnaire][aq]. SUPSI's AI-powered questionnaire to
  determine the most suitable service kit for a manufacturing company.


### Infrastructure services

* [Sensing Layer][sl]. IoT connectivity solution developed by Holonix.
* [FIWARE middleware][fw]. "Powered by FIWARE" IoT communication,
  data exchange and interoperability backbone developed by Martel.
* [QuantumLeap][ql]. Service for storing and querying spatial-temporal
  IoT data developed by Martel.
